# What is Taylor University?
Taylor University (TU) is an inter-denominational, 
evangelical Christian university that was founded in 1846.  
We’re honored that U.S. News and World Report ranked us the number one baccalaureate institution in the Midwest for most of the past thirteen years.

Although we’re a liberal arts school, 
we have a strong School of Science, 
including seven faculty members in Computer Science and Engineering.  
We’re expanding TU’s commitment to science, 
now enjoying the use of a new $41M science building,
which includes dedicated lab space for Missions Computing.

# What is Missions Computing?

Missions Computing refers to the intersection 
of the Great Commission (Matt 28.18-20), 
the Great Commandments (Mark 12.29-31), 
and modern computing.  
Of course, we know that Spirit-empowered people (not computers) 
carry out the work of evangelism and ministry.  
But computers are powerful tools that help people work more efficiently and effectively.

# How did Missions Computing get started at Taylor?

Professor Wally Roth, 
who founded the Computer Science department at Taylor in 1979, 
undertook the first Missions Computing project right after the department got started. 
Wally worked with Operation Mobilization (OM) and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) 
to install a database system aboard the OM ship _Doulos_
to keep track of their inventory of books and literature.

Money raised by Wally served as the seed funding 
for many additional Missions Computing projects undertaken 
by Computer Science faculty, staff, and students at Taylor since 1979.

# Who else has Taylor served through missions computing projects?

Over the years, there have been many groups we’ve been privileged to serve, 
including Wycliffe Bible Translators, SIL International, World Gospel Mission, HCJB Global,
Crescent Project, and New Tribes Mission.  
In addition, we’ve worked with several organizations that wish to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of their ministry.

# What opportunities are there at Taylor for students who are interested in Missions Computing?

Students in TU’s Computer Science and Engineering (CS&E) program 
have many opportunities to engage with the missions community.  
Several courses include substantial team projects.  
Rather than having students create “throw away” software, 
we enlist missions partners to work with professors and students 
on meaningful projects.

For example, our two-semester _Information Systems Analysis and Design_ sequence 
trains systems analysts and software developers 
in the skills necessary to build large software systems 
that meet real-world customer requirements.  
Over the years, these classes have worked directly 
with senior Information Technology (IT) staff 
at numerous missions organizations 
to analyze, design, and prototype significant software systems.  
The result for students is marketable, real-world experience.  
The result for missions partners is a solid analysis of key IT needs
and working prototypes of software solutions.

# What about student opportunities outside of the classroom?

Our students are required to enroll in a practicum 
in which they can put what they’ve learned in class to practical use.  
Although it’s not a requirement, 
we encourage students to consider a practicum with a missions organization. 
The organization benefits, 
and the students get first-hand experience with what it’s really like 
to be a missions technologist.  
By demystifying missions in this way, 
we hope more students will be open to a call 
to serve the missions community with their technical skills.

Many missions organizations look for student interns 
to supplement their software development and IT work.  
According to a senior manager at SIL International, i
nterns are the most valuable outside contributors to projects at SIL/Wycliffe.

Another great way for students to get connected with missions organizations 
and their computing needs is to attend the annual 
International Conference on Computing and Missions (ICCM).

# What is the ICCM conference?

Founded by Bob Hodge, then Taylor’s CIO, in 1989, 
ICCM brings together Christian technologists every June 
for learning, encouragement, and fellowship 
around the themes of missions and computing.  
Some have described ICCM as “Promise Keepers for geeks.”

In the last several years, ICCM has also gone international, 
with conferences held in various countries in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.

# Does Missions Computing at Taylor extend beyond the Computer Science and Engineering department?

In January 2010, 
we established the Taylor Center for Missions Computing (TCMC).
One of several “Centers of Excellence” on the TU campus, 
the CMC is a campus-wide ministry 
that seeks to engage faculty, staff, and students throughout our community 
in meeting the computing needs of the missions community.  
For example, we have connected CS&E students and Art students 
to collaborate on the visual design of web sites, 
and we’ve engaged with Business faculty 
to coordinate “Business as Mission” opportunities.

A locus for leadership, coordination, and funding, 
the CMC’s vision is to “discover, develop, disseminate, and deploy 
computational knowledge and tools to missionaries and through missionaries.”  
This is a tall order, but we think that it’s a natural outcome 
of the work that Taylor CS&E has been doing for over forty years.  

# Is participation on projects within the Center for Missions Computing open to those outside of Taylor?

Yes! The harvest is great, but the programmers are few!

Seriously, the CMC wants to serve four main constituencies.
1. Our missions partners around the world. 
2. Consistent with Taylor’s educational mandate,
   Taylor students, faculty, and staff.
3. Other Christian schools.  
   We’re taking what we’ve learned at TU about serving the missions community
   and exporting this knowledge to other schools 
   that have the interest and ability to engage in Missions Computing work, 
   but may not have the resources or critical mass of support necessary 
   to do it on their own.
4. Christian technologists at large 
   who are interested in contributing to Missions Computing, 
   but have not had access meaningful, stable volunteer opportunities.  
   Think of this group as a “Christian Open Source” movement, 
   applying the same organizational models employed by 
   Apache, Linux, and Python, but to Missions Computing projects.
   The CMC can provide a home for Missions Computing projects 
   that welcome contributions from the open-source community.
